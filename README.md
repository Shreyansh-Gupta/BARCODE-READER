A barcode reader is an optical scanner that can read printed barcodes, decode the data contained in the barcode and send the data to a computer. A barcode is used to encode information in a visual pattern readable by a machine. Barcodes are used for a variety of reasons including tracking products, prices, and stock levels for centralized recording in a computer software system.

Pyzbar and opencv libraries have been used for detecting and decoding the barcode or QR code. Our app takes in an input image, decodes the barcode/ QR code value and outputs the value or link in the code. The pyzbar library can read one-dimensional barcodes and QR codes using the zbar library.
